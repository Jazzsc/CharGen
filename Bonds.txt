I am on a mission in order to recover a lost relic of my faith.
My most treasured possession reminds me of a loved one.
Nothing is more important to me than my people.
I will protet those I serve with.
I will get revenge on those who made me an outcast.
I hold an ancient text that must never fall into the wrong hands.
All I do is for the common people.
Any injury to nature is an injury to me.
My love was murdered. Someday I will have my vengeance.
I admire and aim to surpass my childhood hero.
I am loyal to my sovereign.
I will become a champion of the common people.
I sold my soul for knowledge. I hope to win it back.
I know of an upcoming disaster that only I can prevent.
I am in love with someone I cannot be with.
I work to preserve the knowledge of my people.
