I will do anything for the sake of my people.
I will protect those important to me.
As our times change so too must we.
All things come from knowledge.
I will help others at all cost.
Our past must never be forgotten it is where we find who we are.
We must not cloud our thinking with emotions.
I do what I must and follow just authority.
People following orders blindly embrace tyranny.
I'm only in it for the money and fame.
I wish only to achieve power, so that I will never obey anyway.
Meddling in the affairs of others only leads to trouble.
Only through power will the victor be decided.
Through battle I will achieve honour for me and my people.
Ideals aren't worth killing or fighting a war for.
Art shows us we are, It reflects our souls.
The strong are meant to rule.
I will protect and care for those I am responsible for.
Only through knowledge will we progress.
I will create my own legacy in this world.
I work to improve the world.
